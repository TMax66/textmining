Eng;Breaker;United States;M;> 60;specialization course (master, PhD degree) ;Chartered Engineer in Materials Science with a diverse background in production, research, and academics.  A number of specialties in various disciplines. Work in human physiology and behavior as it relates to an industrial environment.  Grew up with horses and cattle before I went astray into science and technology.. ;Proper diet, clean water, safe facility and storm protection, and adequate training and exercise so the horse knows the role and relationship served.;A sudden or never experienced noise close by will cause a horse to turn and flee in panic with no though except escape.  Noises from further off will cause alert stance and possible agitation.  Noises experienced in a behavioral desensitizing environment will be ignored unless occurring close at hand and unexpectedly much like a human startle response.  Environment will dictate many responses as they can be interpreted as predatory.;A horse as a herd animal will become agitated and potentially despondent when isolated from the herd. They can also become more difficult to handle unless a bond on some order is formed.  Over time a horse can acclimate to a isolate environment, but their physic is affected to some level.  Reintegration can be problematic and their response to humans can become disrespectful if the human is considered part of the herd and not possessing the appropriate dominance characteristics.  Horses need The stimulation of companionship as well as the comfort.;Dependent on the level of training, adjustment, desensitization, contact, and temperament a horse will respond in a generally consistent manner.  In some ways, like cats, they can be at turns diffident, curious, or affectionate.  Relationship is based on familiarity and will be different for each horse in each situation.  Horses are by and large individuals and will act out their personalities based on know expectations and the leeway they interpret.  They always watch and always study.  Response is often based on their interpretation of the dominance relationship.;Horses as prey animals will always react with a survival instinct where no other knowledge is available.  A well trained, well adjusted, and well socialized horse will, by experience, judge most situations as normal and respond accordingly.  With other animals they will be curious or wary dependent on the other animal's acts and actions.  Tension translates quite a distance animal to animal through smell and a subtle posturing of body.  Tension from humans is also easily noticed by the same means as well as acts and actions.  Loud sudden movement will begat a rather negative response.;If the noise is unfamiliar the horse will alert.  If the noise is close at hand the horse will snort and become agitated.  If the noise is sudden, loud, or unrecognized the horse can blindly panic following an instinctual habit of flight.  Horses can be injured in this manner.  If by experience the noise is one associated with negative consequences all the above applies.  If through experience, unless the noise is sudden or unexpected, the horse will generally ignore the source or follow their curiosity to investigate.  The horse will invariably feel threatened or not situation dependent.;"Will feel a certain incompleteness or loneliness; they are herd animals and instinctually expect companionship.  Without other horses they feel particularly vulnerable and this may create a heightened level of stress consequently causing health or behavioral issues.  Not unlike humans or any animal evolved in environments populated by groups a horse will react according to its individuality and psychological flaws.  Think of the isolated human and how they are dramatically affected in the same situation.  A horse will be similarly affected.";Generally comfortable even when there is some ongoing negative interactions.  It is the world they know and the environment they most understand and anticipate.  Without exception they know their place and even with continued competition there are seldom unexpected surprises.  The predators are kept at bay psychologically so the vulnerability is lessened.  Everything maintains a generally neutral familiarness.  Relationships are based on learned interactions and unless a new factor is introduced will continue with the same trends. ;A horse with a lot of diverse human contact will fell comfortable unless some tension translates itself to the horses senses.  Animals with similar habits and behaviors will also be found acceptable unless there are underlying tensions transmitted.  A well adjusted horse responds with the same evenness when the conditions are interpreted as non threatening.  A horse without proper familiarization will fell vulnerable therefore under constant and immediate threat.  Again, a human in an unfamiliar situation without adequate experience in similar situations, will respond with wariness possibly bordering on fear.  Horses as prey animals have great fear of what is unknown.;"The horses condition first of all.  Is there an appropriate and proper fencing enclosure?  Is there necessary shelter from the elements; shade for sunny days and overhead coverage from rain, and possible enclosure for cold weather.  Is location safe from implements that could injure a horse or substances which could affect health.  Is there over crowding?  Adequate forage or the equivalent; access to clean and in contaminated water.  Are the horses abused or show signs of abuse?  Is the general treatment and care at of at least socially and professionally accepted measures.  Is there a know history of problems or conversely a history of superior handling?";Appropriate grains or manufactured feeds.  Adequate supply of hay, forage, or pasture.  Adequate daily allocation of all feeds.  A well balanced feed approach is always hoped for, but each location will generally design according to need, practice, and knowledge.;The horses show no sign of abuse or constant injury.  An indication of proper wound care and health treatment.  Critical veterinary visits for immunization and disease control.  A neighbor failing in proper health requirements and treatments could create an epidemic that could decimate my animals as a byproduct of their gross negligence.  Horses should have decent hoof care and not exhibit signs of lameness.  Horses should not show signs of starvation or ill health.  Disease spreads and negligence exceeds the bounds of any given facility to affect all nearby and by extension through transportation nationally or further.;Generally normal behavior signifies the probability of a normal herd.  These animals should pose no problems of health or behavior. ;Aggressiveness could be a cautionary sign.  Other abnormal behavior could be the sign of the onset of disease with its corresponding consequences.  A single animal could indicate an animal with births defects or without related cause the onset of illness.  The question is always is this systemic to the given animal or something contagious.

They should be given as much access to pasture in the company of other horses as possible; stabling should be kept to an absolute minimum. No horse should be denied turnout and access to other horses. Appropriate shelter must be provided at pasture. Horses should be bred for robustness against injury as well as performance. Young should stay with the mothers for several months (at least six) and then be weaned naturally. Breeding procedures involving stress, such as use of restraints like the twitch and hobbles should not be used. Management should be planned to avoid fear and distress from birth to death, which should be humane. Training, riding and driving methods should be based upon positive reinforcement, and should not involve fear, stress or injury. ";Will orient to the noise, exhibiting the classic startle response. Depending upon the source, the horse may flee. Over time, if the source does not result in positive or negative consequences, the horse may habituate and respond less or not at all to the noise. During the initial startle response, the horse may experience stress.;Will experience significant stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion, vocalisation, frequent defaecation, attempts to escape the location and head back to the herd, and may tremble. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary cortisol levels. If prolonged, the rise in cortisol may result in immunosupression, maming the horse more vulnerable to infectious disease.;May experience less stress than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no stress. However, this will depend upon the behaviour of the animals or people. If they perform behaviour which does engender stress, the habitution responsible for the reduced response may break down.;May experience stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion, aggression or attempting to escape the location. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary cortisol levels. If prolonged, the rise in cortisol may result in immunosuppression, making the horse more vulnerable to infectious disease. The behaviour of the unfamiliar animal or person may modify this response over time. If the behaviour towards the horse is neutral or positive it may habituate to their presence. If it is negative the horse may not habituate, indeed its behavioural and physiological responses to the stress may intensify.;May feel fear.  If the noise occurs repeatedly the fear felt at each instance may decline over time as the horse habituates to the noise. If the consequences of the noise are negative (e.g. result in pain, isolation or stress) the fear may intensify.;Is likely to feel fear, lasting for the duration of the isolation.;May experience less fear than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no fear.

Bright eyes and clean nostrils. Are horses sound, do they follow what's happening around them or are they apathetic or looking sick. Hooves should look trimmed and hoof walls should look smooth. ;Horses are relaxed but still interested in their surroundings, they are eating hay or grazing, socializing together and allogrooming too.;Horses are restless or anxious, moving back and forth, performing aggressive behaviour to the other horses or even to themselves. If hay is present, horses that do not eat but walk/trot around instead. Sick or malnutritioned horses may look apathetic, too sleepy and they do not respond to the environmental signals. Also crib biting and weaving are abnormal behaviour, although the original reason for them can be already removed (so they may not be the best indicator of problems in present horse management).

Eng;Owner;United States;F;51-60;university degree ;Bs in Allied Health;Safe covered housing or, a safe pasture that is big enough for the horse for exercise. Companionship with other herd animals optimally with at least one other horse although a band size of 4-6 is premium. Mixed sex and mixed age within the band is very good. Adult and adolescent geldings mixed with adult and adolescent mares mixed with yearlings and foals is perfect. Horses need the opportunity to be and act like horses so the chance to be in open pasture with a mixed age/mixed sex band is very good for them. Standing in a stall or being in a small paddock by themselves all day will make them neurotic. They need daily exercise, the need to forage for their food so rather than giving all food in a manger it is best to scatter food around the pasture to mimic the natural foraging of wild horses. They need access to fresh clean water constantly. They need their hooves trimmed but don't always need shoes. They need activities that not only keep them physically fit and toned but provide mental stimulation as well. They need to never, ever be beat.;Throws their head up, turn toward the noise,flare their nostrils. If there is no threat the horse will slowly approach and investigate whatever is making the noise. If a threat is perceived the horse will wheel and run away. Horses are very curious and very brave so if they don't feel a true threat their curiosity will win out and they will investigate.;Will become depressed, will eat less and become very flat. A horse that is raised all of their life isolated from other horses will be neurotic and unstable. If a horse is isolated from other horses but can hear them he can become so desperate he can actually hurt himself attempting to rejoin other horses. I believe a horse can die from depression and isolation can be a huge cause of this.;Is welcoming.

Will softly blow their breath in a friends face and breath their friends breath in response;It depends on the horse but generally they will raise their heads, turn toward the newcomer, flair their nostrils to get a scent of them. If they feel safe they will lower their head slightly and approach the newcomer carefully. When next to them they will extend their neck to get a good smell and decide if they want to get to know the newcomer further.; Startled, curious, stressful or frightened.;Feels depressed, stressful, sad, desperate, unsafe, unhappy, angry.;Feels calm, happy, free of stress, safe, inquisitive, fulfilled. ;Feels on edge, possibly curious, possibly unsafe, threatened, stimulated, inquisitive depending on the horse and the environment.;Covered shelter with at least three sides preferably four with large door that faces away from the prevailing wind.

Horses need a controlled supply of forage, not too much grass. They need to be free from parasites and diseases and have their conditioned checked daily. They need access to shelter from wind and rain. They need to be kept with other horses preferably in a herd with other horses and allowed to run and play and groom each other. They need to be trained to overcome fears and concerns about humans and about their environment so that they can be confident to be handled, have medical treatment and to do whatever job they are asked to do. They need space to roam and forage. They should not be kept in stables for periods longer than 12 hours in every 24 ideally.;Might raise his head and look in the direction of the noise..

Free exercise several hours in a field/ 24 h with run in shed - it has to be large enough so that the horses can avoid each others if necessary.

It is a plus if the horses can see each other (I think they should be). That the air in the barn is fresh and dust free, that there is enough natural light and that the ceiling is not too low. Personally I think it is unacceptable not to turn horses out with companions - so that will also be important. Mud-free turn out, enough space so that the horse can avoid each other, safe and visible fence. Horses should always have access to fresh water and some sort of hay/straw to eat. ;That the horse is not too fat or too thin. You can feel the ribs with a flat hand, perhaps see the last too.
