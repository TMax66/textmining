Eng;Veterinarian;United Kingdom;M;41-50;specialization course (master, PhD degree) ;PhD in Animal Welfare, Honours Degree in Zoology;"The fitness, health and productivity of donkeys should be protected by adapting their conditions and management to their biology and natural behaviour. They should be given as much access to pasture in the company of other donkeys as possible; stabling should be kept to an absolute minimum. No donkeys should be denied turnout and access to other donkeys. Appropriate shelter must be provided at pasture. Donkeys should be bred for robustness against injury as well as performance. Young should stay with the mothers for several months (at least six) and then be weaned naturally. Breeding procedures involving stress, such as use of restraints like the twitch and hobbles should not be used. Management should be planned to avoid fear and distress from birth to death, which should be humane. Training, riding and driving methods should be based upon positive reinforcement, and should not involve fear, stress or injury.";Will orient to the noise, exhibiting the classic startle response. Depending upon the source, the donkey may flee. Over time, if the source does not result in positive or negative consequences, the donkey may habituate and respond less or not at all to the noise. During the initial startle response, the donkey may experience stress.;Will experience significant stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion, vocalisation, attempts to escape the location, and head back to the herd. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary cortisol levels. If prolonged, the rise in cortisol may result in immunosupression, making the donkey more vulnerable to infectious disease.;May experience less stress than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no stress. However, this will depend upon the behaviour of the animals or people. If they perform behaviour which does engender stress, the habitution responsible for the reduced response may break down.;May experience significant stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion and attempts to escape the location. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary cortisol levels. If prolonged, the rise in cortisol may result in immunosuppression, making the donkey more vulnerable to infectious disease. The behaviour of the unfamiliar animal or person may modify this response over time. If the behaviour towards the donkey is neutral or positive it may habituate to their presence. If it is negative it may not habituate, indeed its behavioural and physiological responses to the stress may intensify.;Will feel fear.  If the noise occurs repeatedly the fear felt at each instance may decline over time as the donkey habituates to the noise. If the consequences of the noise are negative (e.g. result in pain, isolation or stress) the fear may intensify.  ;Will feel fear, lasting for the duration of the isolation.;May experience less fear than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no fear. However, this will depend upon the behaviour of the animals or people. If they perform behaviour which does engender fear, the habitution responsible for the reduced response may break down.;May feel fear. The behaviour of the unfamiliar animal or person may modify this fear over time. If the behaviour towards the donkey is neutral or positive it may habituate to their presence and feel less and eventually no fear. If it is negative it may not habituate, indeed its fear may intensify.;Presence and cleanliness of bedding, repair and maintenance of buildings, paddock and equipment.;Cleanliness of feeding and water troughs, access to pasture, quality of feed provided (eg lacking dust and mould). Majority of feed should be pasture and roughage such as hay. Quantity of feed provided. Animals neither obese nor thin. Access to clean water should be ad lib.;Bright eyes, no discharges, no lameness. No lesions or wounds. Normal heart rate, respiration rate and body temprature. No areas of lost, damaged or piloerected coat. Normal faeces and urine colour. Normal interest in surroundings, normal appetite and social behaviour.;Inquisitive and reactive to enviornment, including presence of observer. Not over-reactive to observer- no extreme avoindance responses. Staying with the herd. May approach observer. Normal interest in food.;Extreme avoidance behaviour, extreme reactivity to stimulation. No interest in food or water. Avoiding rest of herd. Stereotypical behaviour. Learned helplessness- ie unresponsive to presence of observer or environmental stimulation.
