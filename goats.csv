Eng;Veterinary ;United Kingdom;M;41-50;specialization course (master, PhD degree) ;PhD in Animal Welfare, Honours Degree in Zoology;"The fitness, health and productivity of goats should be protected by adapting their conditions and management to their biology and natural behaviour. They should be given a varied environment with loose material and other enrichments and as much outdoor space as possible, with pasture or browse at least during the growing season.Goats should be bred and managed for robustness and for ease of birth; this is particularly important where meat production is integrated with dairying. Young should stay with the mothers for several months and then be weaned naturally. Management should be planned to avoid fear and distress from birth to slaughter.";Will orient to the noise, exhibiting the classic startle response. Depending upon the source, the goat may flee. Over time, if the source does not result in positive or negative consequences, the goat may habituate and respond less or not at all to the noise. During the initial startle response, the goat may experience stress.;Will experience significant stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion, vocalisation, attempts to escape the location and head back to the flock, and may tremble. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary cortisol levels. If prolonged, the rise in cortisol may result in immunosupression, maming the goat more vulnerable to infectious disease.;May experience less stress than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no stress. However, this will depend upon the behaviour of the animals or people. If they perform behaviour which does engender stress, the habitution responsible for the reduced response may break down.;May experience significant stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion and attempts to escape the location and may tremble. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary cortisol levels. If prolonged, the rise in cortisol may result in immunosuppression, making the goat more vulnerable to infectious disease. The behaviour of the unfamiliar animal or person may modify this response over time. If the behaviour towards the goat is neutral or positive it may habituate to their presence. If it is negative it may not habituate, indeed its behavioural and physiological responses to the stress may intensify.;Will feel fear.  If the noise occurs repeatedly the fear felt at each instance may decline over time as the goat habituates to the noise. If the consequences of the noise are negative (e.g. result in pain, isolation or stress) the fear may intensify.;Will feel fear, lasting for the duration of the isolation.;May experience less fear than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no fear. However, this will depend upon the behaviour of the animals or people. If they perform behaviour which does engender fear, the habitution responsible for the reduced response may break down.;May feel fear. The behaviour of the unfamiliar animal or person may modify this fear over time.

This is a good time to get to know your goat so when illness or disease strike you have a good understanding of your goats personality and basic health. Hooves should be cleaned and inspected once a day and feet trimmed every other month. When kids are born the decision needs to be made whether or not to castrate the bucks and at approximately six weeks horn buds need to be burned to encourage proper horn growth or absence if horns are not desired.";Throws their head up, looks in the direction of the noise, often will bleat to alert the others in the herd and last bolt and run away. If there are kids in the group the adults often will circle around the kids in an attempt to protect them from a threat.;Will bleat and bleat and bleat. They will also attempt to climb on the highest point in the vicinity to see if they can see any herd mates. If they are isolated for days they will often stop eating and become depressed.;Will trot over to greet them, wag their tails briskly, bleat a hello. If a fence is in between them the goat will stand with their front feet on the fence so they might see the other animal/person better. If they greet you in the pasture they will trot up, wag their tails briskly and stand very close, sometimes they will butt. ;will raise their heads to see them better, will gather around to smell them better. If they feel threatened they will run away.;Often feels curious, if danger such as a predator is present they feel threatened and frightened but they also have great courage and will band together to protect their children. If doe goats hear the sounds of a pregnant goat in labor the does that have had kids understand what is about to befall the laboring goat. They feel compassion for her and those who have had kids before will gather around the goat in labor and encircle her. The alpha doe will stand in front of the laboring doe with their foreheads pressing against each others. As the laboring doe makes the stressful noises of birth the alpha doe will make low, soft, murmuring sounds to comfort her and help her feel less alone and afraid. It's wonderful to see.;Will feel very depressed. They feel very lonely without their companions and will eventually stop eating and can eventually die. They feel vulnerable by themselves and also feel a deep need to be part of the social order of their herd.;Feels safe and secure and feels very happy when they see familiar animals or people that they haven't seen for a few days. They enjoy celebrating and playing with people and animals that they are bonded with.;Feels stand-offish and suspicious. With very little provocation they feel fear.;Access to at least a three sided enclosure to provide shelter from the weather although a four sided enclosure with a nice wide door for walk-in is better. The door should face opposite of the direction that bad weather typically approaches from. There should be clean straw on the ground that is changed and freshened every week. The roof should be very secure since the goats will climb all over it if A possible. If there are more than four or five goats in the herd the enclosure will also need some type of venting in the roof to make sure ammonia gas doesn't build up from urine and straw composting. Also trees or bushes for them to get shade from the sun is good to have.;A very strong, firmly mounted manger for supplemental hay. Access to a multi-miineral salt block. Appropriate amount of pasture grass for number of goats in herd as well as plenty of brows such as shrubs, bushes, trees for roughage, variety, vitamins and minerals. Constant access to fresh, clean water. In cold weather there should be a place off the ground to offer grain.;I would assess their overall condition. I would make sure that their ribs aren't showing and they don't look gaunt. I would look at their coats and make sure that their coat isn't dry, hair not falling out. I would look at their feet and make sure their feet don't smell because of fungus rot. Make certain hooves aren't overgrown and are properly trimmed. If possible I would try to touch the goats to make certain they don't have any tumors or cysts and to get close enough to look at their eyes to make certain that they are clear and that their noses aren't runny. I would also asses for any obvious signs of parasites such as the presents of worms. If I can get close enough I would also like to smell their breath. A heathy goat has nice, sweet breath.;I would want to see climbing, butting, galloping, bucking, playing and jumping in kids and adolescents.
