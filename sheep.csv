Eng;Veterinarian;United Kingdom;M;41-50;specialization course (master, PhD degree) ;PhD in Animal Welfare, Honours Degree in Zoology;"The fitness, health and productivity of sheep should be protected by adapting their conditions and management to their biology and natural behaviour. They should be given a varied environment with loose material and other enrichments and as much outdoor space as possible, with pasture or browse at least during the growing season.Sheep should be bred and managed for robustness and for ease of birth; this is particularly important where meat production is integrated with dairying. Young should stay with the mothers for several months and then be weaned naturally. Management should be planned to avoid fear and distress from birth to slaughter.";Will orient to the noise, exhibiting the classic startle response. Depending upon the source, the sheep may flee. Over time, if the source does not result in positive or negative consequences, the sheep may habituate and respond less or not at all to the noise. During the initial startle response, the sheep may experience stress. ;Will experience significant stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion, vocalisation, attempts to escape the location and head back to the flock, and may tremble. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary cortisol levels. If prolonged, the rise in cortisol may result in immunosuppression, making the sheep more vulnerable to infectious disease.;May experience less stress than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no stress. However, this will depend upon the behaviour of the animals or people. If they perform behaviour which does engender stress, the habitution responsible for the reduced response may break down. ;May experience significant stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion and attempts to escape the location and may tremble. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary cortisol levels. If prolonged, the rise in cortisol may result in immunosuppression, making the sheep more vulnerable to infectious disease. The behaviour of the unfamiliar animal or person may modify this response over time. If the behaviour towards the sheep is neutral or positive the sheep may habituate to their presence. If it is negative the sheep may not habituate, indeed its behavioural and physiological responses to the stress may intensify. ;Will feel fear. If the noise occurs repeatedly the fear felt at each instance may decline over time as the sheep habituates to the noise. If the consequences of the noise are negative (e.g. result in pain, isolation or stress) the fear may intensify. ;Will feel fear, lasting for the duration of the isolation. ;May experience less fear than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no fear.

The sheep show a very strong gregarious behavior in pens as well as grazing. Isolation of individual sheep brings with it signs of anxiety. The separation of the herd is the main cause of the sheep trying to escape. The lambs tend to follow each other, even in activities such as shepherding, lying, reacting to obstacles and feeding. Displacement; response to low availability of forage. Night grazing vs. diurnal Cohesion of grazing groups. Mutual shading under heat stress. Footprints under barbed wire with low availability.
