Eng;Veterinarian;United Kingdom;M;41-50;specialization course (master, PhD degree) ;PhD in Animal Welfare, Honours Degree in Zoology;The fitness, health and productivity of turkeys should be protected by adapting their conditions and management to their biology and natural behaviour. They should be given a varied environment with loose material and other enrichments and as much outdoor access as possible. Turkeys should be bred and managed for robustness and low behavioural problems rather than for excessive production. Turkeys should be able to mate naturally. Lighting indoors should be adequate for normal behaviour, with a gradual dawn and dusk and an uninterrupted resting period at night. If outdoor access is not possible there should be windows to provide natural light. Housing needs to take size and weight into account, with low nests and perches, solid floors and sufficient height for headroom. Management of all flocks should be planned to avoid fear and distress from hatching to slaughter.   ;Will orient to the noise, exhibiting the classic startle response. Depending upon the source, the turkey may flee. Over time, if the source does not result in positive or negative consequences, it may habituate and respond less or not at all to the noise. During the initial startle response, it may experience stress.;May experience significant stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion, vocalisation, attempts to escape the location and head back to the flock. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary corticoid levels. If prolonged, the rise in corticoids may result in immunosupression, making the turkey more vulnerable to infectious disease.;May experience less stress than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no stress. However, this will depend upon the behaviour of the animals or people. If they perform behaviour which does engender stress, the habitution responsible for the reduced response may break down.;May experience stress, exhibiting behavioural indicators such as locomotion and attempts to escape the location. Heart rate and respiration rate may rise, as may plasma and salivary corticoid levels. If prolonged, the rise in corticoids may result in immunosuppression, making the turkey more vulnerable to infectious disease. The behaviour of the unfamiliar animal or person may modify this response over time. If the behaviour towards the turkey is neutral or positive it may habituate to their presence. If it is negative it may not habituate, indeed its behavioural and physiological responses to the stress may intensify.  ;Will feel fear.  If the noise occurs repeatedly the fear felt at each instance may decline over time as the turkey habituates to the noise. If the consequences of the noise are negative (e.g. result in pain, isolation or stress) the fear may intensify.;May feel fear, lasting for the duration of the isolation.;May experience less fear than that discussed above regarding isolation, or indeed no fear. However, this will depend upon the behaviour of the animals or people. If they perform behaviour which does engender fear, the habitution responsible for the reduced response may break down.;May feel fear. The behaviour of the unfamiliar animal or person may modify this fear over time. If the behaviour towards the turkey is neutral or positive it may habituate to their presence and feel less and eventually no fear. If it is negative it may not habituate, indeed its fear may intensify.;Presence and cleanliness of bedding, repair and maintenance of buildings and equipment.;Cleanliness of feeding and water troughs, quality of feed provided (eg lacking dust and mould). Quantity of feed provided. Animals neither obese nor thin.; Bright eyes, no discharges, no lameness. No lesions or wounds. Normal heart rate, respiration rate and body temprature.

Minimization of unnecessary stress factors.   Plan to minimize risk of disease (infectious and non-infectious).  Clean litter in the first few weeks of life and litter maintained to decrease enteric pathogen exposure. Good air quality.  Enough space to allow movement and access to food and water and minimize stress.;Variable depending on situation. Flock of turkeys during the day will become quiet and alert for a period of time if the noise is relatively unique. If acclimated, they may not respond. Male turkeys may mimic a male turkey sound. At night, birds may startle, pile, and scratch depending on the type of sound and acclimation.;"Will attempt to rejoin the flock if possible. If ill, then may be depressed and reluctant to move. Birds kept as individuals will acclimate; pet turkeys.";Variable responses. If very familiar, turkeys may approach and interact. Some may move away cautiously but be curious. Some may move away a little or not approach until after a short period of time. Some may keep distance until there is something that further attracts their attention (food, shiny object, small movements).;Variable responses depending on how unfamiliar. Some flocks will scatter and move away from the object rapidly, possibly causing piling and scratching. Some may move away cautiously. Some may have enough overall human interaction that they will approach and interact with new people.;Speculation on how the animal feels in these situations is potentially problematic. People can have a different interpretation based on their own personal experiences, which may not be applicable to the health and wellbeing of the birds. People with a lack of understanding of turkeys can misinterpret their behaviours. Efforts should be made to minimize unnecessary stress throughout the life of the birds regardless of its source.  Some stress is necessary (weight management feeding programs, vaccines, etc) to maximize welfare.;Speculation on how the animal feels in these situations is potentially problematic.
